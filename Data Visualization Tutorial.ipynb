    "Greeting, challengers! In this station, you will learn on how to convert data and information into beautiful graphics by using Python. Visual elements like charts, graphs and maps provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers and patterns in data. This step is essentially important when the data scientists want to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) before creating a machine learning model. It is also used to present the findings from the data in a more visual appeal way, because who likes to see a bunch of lengthy sentences when a beautiful graph can summarise all of these at once?\n",
